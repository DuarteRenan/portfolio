                            Hello there! I'm Renan Duarte, a dedicated Front-End Developer passionate about building intuitive, high-performance web experiences. I thrive on translating design concepts into seamless, pixel-perfect user interfaces that truly make a difference.

                        <p data-aos="fade">
                           My journey into development began during college, sparking an immediate passion for problem-solving and creation. Since then, I've been committed to continuous learning, constantly exploring new technologies and best practices to deliver robust and innovative solutions.

                          Outside of coding, you'll find me enjoying video games or practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - activities that sharpen my focus and problem-solving mindset. I'm always on the lookout for fresh ideas, eager to apply new insights to my next exciting project.
